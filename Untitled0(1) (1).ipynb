It originated in an application (no. 19392/92) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Commission under Article 25 by a political party, the United Communist Party of Turkey, and two Turkish nationals, Mr Nihat Sargın and Mr Nabi Yağcı, on 7 January 1992.\\n\\nThe Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (a) of the Convention and to Rule 32 of Rules of Court A. The object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 11 of the Convention.\\n\\n2.\\xa0\\xa0In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 § 3 (d), the applicants stated that they wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyers who would represent them (Rule\\xa030).

The request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration made by the Kingdom of Belgium recognising the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46).  The purpose of the Commission’s request is to obtain a decision from the Court as to whether or not the facts of the case disclose, on the part of the Kingdom of Belgium, a violation of the obligations binding on it under Articles 11 and 14 (art. 11, art. 14) of the Convention.\\n\\n3.

They considered that the measure imposed on them had not been necessary in a democratic society and that it was incompatible with the principle of proportionality. Lastly, the first applicant party observed that the acts referred to in the judgment of the Spanish Supreme Court of 27 March 2003 against the applicant parties had taken place one year before the LOPP had come into force, and that Herri Batasuna had been dissolved even though the Supreme Court had not found it guilty of any such act occurring after the relevant Law had come into force.

The case of Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (\"the Commission\") and the Government of the Kingdom of Belgium (\"the Government\"). The case originated in two applications against that State lodged with the Commission in 1974 and 1975 by three Belgian nationals, Dr. Herman Le Compte, Dr. Frans Van Leuven and Dr. Marc De Meyere, under Article 25 (art. 25) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\"the Convention\"). The Commission ordered the joinder of the applications on 10 March 1977.\\n\\n2. Both the Commission’s request and the Government’s application were lodged with the registry of the Court within the period of three months laid down by Articles 32 par. 1 and 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) - the former on 14 March 1980 and the latter on 23 April 1980. The request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration made by the Kingdom of Belgium recognising the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46); the application referred to Article 48 (art. 48). The purpose of the request and the application is to obtain a decision from the Court as to whether or not the facts of the case disclose a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Articles 6 and 11 (art. 6, art. 11).\\n\\n3. Mr. W. Ganshof van der Meersch, the elected judge of Belgian nationality, was called upon to sit as an ex officio member of the Chamber of seven judges to be constituted (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43). However, by letter dated 21 March 1980, he declared that he withdrew pursuant to Rule 24 par. 2 of the Rules of Court. On 9 April, the Government appointed as ad hoc judge Mr. A. Vanwelkenhuyzen, Professor at the Free University of Brussels (Article 43 of the Convention and Rule 23 par. 1) (art. 43).\\n\\nOn 29 April, Mr. G. Balladore Pallieri, the President of the Court and an ex officio member of the Chamber (Rule 21 par. 3 (b)), drew by lot, in the presence of the Registrar, the names of the five other members, namely Mr. G. Wiarda, Mr. R. Ryssdal, Sir Gerald Fitzmaurice, Mrs. D. Bindschedler-Robert and Mr. L. Liesch (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 par. 4) (art. 43).\\n\\n4. Mr. Balladore Pallieri assumed the office of President of the Chamber (Rule 21 par. 5). He ascertained, through the Registrar, the views of the Agent of the Government and the Delegates of the Commission regarding the procedure to be followed. On 23 May 1980, he decided that the Agent should have until 15 August 1980 to file a memorial and that the Delegates should be entitled to file a memorial in reply within two months from the date of the transmission of the Government’s memorial to them by the Registrar.\\n\\nThe Government’s memorial was received at the registry on 20 August 1980. On 22 October, the Secretary to the Commission informed the Registrar that the Delegates would reply thereto at the hearings; he also transmitted to the Registrar the observations of the applicants’ lawyer on the Commission’s report.\\n\\n5. On 1 October 1980, the Chamber decided under Rule 48 to relinquish jurisdiction forthwith in favour of the plenary Court.\\n\\n6. After consulting, through the Registrar, the Agent of the Government and the Delegates of the Commission, the President of the Court directed on 7 October that the oral proceedings should open on 25 November.\\n\\n7. The oral hearings were held in public at the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 25 November; Mr. Wiarda, then Vice-President of the Court, presided as Mr. Balladore Pallieri was unable to attend.

They considered that the measure imposed on them had not been necessary in a democratic society and that it was incompatible with the principle of proportionality. Lastly, the first applicant party observed that the acts referred to in the judgment of the Spanish Supreme Court of 27 March 2003 against the applicant parties had taken place one year before the LOPP had come into force, and that Herri Batasuna had been dissolved even though the Supreme Court had not found it guilty of any such act occurring after the relevant Law had come into force.

The case of Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (\"the Commission\") and the Government of the Kingdom of Belgium (\"the Government\"). The case originated in two applications against that State lodged with the Commission in 1974 and 1975 by three Belgian nationals, Dr. Herman Le Compte, Dr. Frans Van Leuven and Dr. Marc De Meyere, under Article 25 (art. 25) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\"the Convention\"). The Commission ordered the joinder of the applications on 10 March 1977.\\n\\n2. Both the Commission’s request and the Government’s application were lodged with the registry of the Court within the period of three months laid down by Articles 32 par. 1 and 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) - the former on 14 March 1980 and the latter on 23 April 1980. The request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration made by the Kingdom of Belgium recognising the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46); the application referred to Article 48 (art. 48). The purpose of the request and the application is to obtain a decision from the Court as to whether or not the facts of the case disclose a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Articles 6 and 11 (art. 6, art. 11).\\n\\n3. Mr. W. Ganshof van der Meersch, the elected judge of Belgian nationality, was called upon to sit as an ex officio member of the Chamber of seven judges to be constituted (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43). However, by letter dated 21 March 1980, he declared that he withdrew pursuant to Rule 24 par. 2 of the Rules of Court. On 9 April, the Government appointed as ad hoc judge Mr. A. Vanwelkenhuyzen, Professor at the Free University of Brussels (Article 43 of the Convention and Rule 23 par. 1) (art. 43).\\n\\nOn 29 April, Mr. G. Balladore Pallieri, the President of the Court and an ex officio member of the Chamber (Rule 21 par. 3 (b)), drew by lot, in the presence of the Registrar, the names of the five other members, namely Mr. G. Wiarda, Mr. R. Ryssdal, Sir Gerald Fitzmaurice, Mrs. D. Bindschedler-Robert and Mr. L. Liesch (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 par. 4) (art. 43).\\n\\n4. Mr. Balladore Pallieri assumed the office of President of the Chamber (Rule 21 par. 5). He ascertained, through the Registrar, the views of the Agent of the Government and the Delegates of the Commission regarding the procedure to be followed. On 23 May 1980, he decided that the Agent should have until 15 August 1980 to file a memorial and that the Delegates should be entitled to file a memorial in reply within two months from the date of the transmission of the Government’s memorial to them by the Registrar.\\n\\nThe Government’s memorial was received at the registry on 20 August 1980. On 22 October, the Secretary to the Commission informed the Registrar that the Delegates would reply thereto at the hearings; he also transmitted to the Registrar the observations of the applicants’ lawyer on the Commission’s report.\\n\\n5. On 1 October 1980, the Chamber decided under Rule 48 to relinquish jurisdiction forthwith in favour of the plenary Court.\\n\\n6. After consulting, through the Registrar, the Agent of the Government and the Delegates of the Commission, the President of the Court directed on 7 October that the oral proceedings should open on 25 November.\\n\\n7. The oral hearings were held in public at the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 25 November; Mr. Wiarda, then Vice-President of the Court, presided as Mr. Balladore Pallieri was unable to attend. The Court had held a preparatory meeting immediately before the hearings opened.

The Schmidt and Dahlström case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (hereinafter referred to as \"the Commission\"). The case originated in an application against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Commission by two Swedish subjects, Mr. Folke Schmidt and Mr. Hans Dahlström, on 9 June 1972.\\n\\n2. The Commission’s request, to which was attached the report provided for under Article 31 (art. 31) of the Convention, was lodged with the registry of the Court on 9 October 1974, within the period of three months laid down by Articles 32 para. 1 and 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47). The request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration made by the Kingdom of Sweden recognising the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The purpose of the Commission’s request is to obtain a decision from the Court as to whether or not the facts of the case disclose a failure on the part of the Kingdom of Sweden to comply with the obligations binding on it under Articles 11 and 14 (art. 11, art. 14) of the Convention.\\n\\n3. The President of the Court deemed it conducive to the proper administration of justice to constitute a single Chamber to consider both the present case and that of the Swedish Engine Drivers’ Union (Rule 21 para. 6). On 15 October 1974, the President of the Court drew by lot, in the presence of the Registrar, the names of five of the seven judges required to sit as members of the Chamber, Mr. S. Petrén, the judge of Swedish nationality, and Mr. G. Balladore Pallieri, the President of the Court, being ex officio members under Article 43 (art. 43) of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 3 (b) of the Rules of Court respectively. The five judges so selected were Mr. H. Mosler, Mr. E. Rodenbourg, Mr. A. Favre, Mr. G. Wiarda and Mr. P. O’Donoghue (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 4) (art. 43). Mr. Favre died in November 1974 and Mr. Rodenbourg in October 1975; they were replaced by Mr. J. Cremona and Mrs. H. Pedersen, substitute judges.\\n\\nMr. G. Balladore Pallieri assumed the office of President of the Chamber in accordance with Rule 21 para. 5.\\n\\n4. The President of the Chamber ascertained, through the Registrar, the views of the Agent of the Swedish Government (hereinafter referred to as \"the Government\") and of the delegates of the Commission regarding the procedure to be followed. By an Order of 31 October 1974, the President of the Chamber decided that the Government should file a memorial within a time-limit expiring on 14 February 1975 and that the delegates should be entitled to file a memorial in reply within two months of receipt of the Government’s memorial.\\n\\nThe Government’s memorial was received at the registry on 17 February and that of the delegates on 26 March 1975.\\n\\n5. After consulting, through the Registrar, the Agent of the Government and the delegates of the Commission, the President decided by an Order of 2 June 1975 that the oral hearings should open on 25 September.\\n\\n6. On 22 September 1975, the Court held a preparatory meeting to consider the oral stage of the procedure. On this occasion the Court compiled a list of questions which it sent to the parties appearing before it, requesting them to supply the required information in the course of their addresses. The Court also requested the Commission to produce a certain document.\\n\\n7. The oral hearings were held in public at the Human Rights Building in Strasbourg on 25 September 1975.\\n\\nThere appeared before the Court:\\n\\n- for the Government:\\n\\n\\tMr. H. DANELIUS, Head of the Legal Department\\n\\n\\t\\tat the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, \\t\\t   Agent;\\n\\n\\tMr. B. HÅRDEFELT, Chief Legal Adviser\\n\\n\\t\\tat the Ministry of Finance,\\n\\n\\tMr. G. NORMARK, Chief Legal Adviser\\n\\n\\t\\tat the National Collective Bargaining Office,\\n\\n\\tMr. O.

It originated in an application (no. 19392/92) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Commission under Article 25 by a political party, the United Communist Party of Turkey, and two Turkish nationals, Mr Nihat Sargın and Mr Nabi Yağcı, on 7 January 1992.\\n\\nThe Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (a) of the Convention and to Rule 32 of Rules of Court A. The object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 11 of the Convention.\\n\\n2.\\xa0\\xa0In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 § 3 (d), the applicants stated that they wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyers who would represent them (Rule\\xa030). The lawyers were given leave by the President to use the Turkish language in the written and oral stages of the proceedings (Rule 27 § 3).\\n\\n3.\\xa0\\xa0The Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Mr F.

Pekkanen and Mr\\xa0R.\\xa0Macdonald (Rule 51 §\\xa02\\xa0(a) and (b)).

Valticos, Mrs\\xa0E. Palm, Mr J.M. Morenilla, Sir\\xa0John\\xa0Freeland, Mr L. Wildhaber and Mr U. Lōhmus (Rule 51§\\xa02 (c)).

He therefore requested that the case be heard in his absence and annexed an unsolicited document of nine pages in which, in substance, he replied to the arguments developed in the Government’s observations before the Grand Chamber. In a letter of 30 October 2014 the Court informed the Government that, given the applicants’ representative’s position, it might consider dispensing with a public hearing and giving the parties the opportunity to file a written reply to each other’s observations.

Lastly, the first applicant party observed that the acts referred to in the judgment of the Spanish Supreme Court of 27 March 2003 against the applicant parties had taken place one year before the LOPP had come into force, and that Herri Batasuna had been dissolved even though the Supreme Court had not found it guilty of any such act occurring after the relevant Law had come into force.

The Schmidt and Dahlström case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (hereinafter referred to as \"the Commission\"). The case originated in an application against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Commission by two Swedish subjects, Mr. Folke Schmidt and Mr. Hans Dahlström, on 9 June 1972.\\n\\n2. The Commission’s request, to which was attached the report provided for under Article 31 (art. 31) of the Convention, was lodged with the registry of the Court on 9 October 1974, within the period of three months laid down by Articles 32 para. 1 and 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47). The request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration made by the Kingdom of Sweden recognising the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The purpose of the Commission’s request is to obtain a decision from the Court as to whether or not the facts of the case disclose a failure on the part of the Kingdom of Sweden to comply with the obligations binding on it under Articles 11 and 14 (art. 11, art. 14) of the Convention.\\n\\n3. The President of the Court deemed it conducive to the proper administration of justice to constitute a single Chamber to consider both the present case and that of the Swedish Engine Drivers’ Union (Rule 21 para. 6). On 15 October 1974, the President of the Court drew by lot, in the presence of the Registrar, the names of five of the seven judges required to sit as members of the Chamber, Mr. S. Petrén, the judge of Swedish nationality, and Mr. G. Balladore Pallieri, the President of the Court, being ex officio members under Article 43 (art. 43) of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 3 (b) of the Rules of Court respectively. The five judges so selected were Mr. H. Mosler, Mr. E. Rodenbourg, Mr. A. Favre, Mr. G. Wiarda and Mr. P. O’Donoghue (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 4) (art. 43). Mr. Favre died in November 1974 and Mr. Rodenbourg in October 1975; they were replaced by Mr. J. Cremona and Mrs. H. Pedersen, substitute judges.\\n\\nMr. G. Balladore Pallieri assumed the office of President of the Chamber in accordance with Rule 21 para. 5.\\n\\n4. The President of the Chamber ascertained, through the Registrar, the views of the Agent of the Swedish Government (hereinafter referred to as \"the Government\") and of the delegates of the Commission regarding the procedure to be followed. By an Order of 31 October 1974, the President of the Chamber decided that the Government should file a memorial within a time-limit expiring on 14 February 1975 and that the delegates should be entitled to file a memorial in reply within two months of receipt of the Government’s memorial.\\n\\nThe Government’s memorial was received at the registry on 17 February and that of the delegates on 26 March 1975.\\n\\n5. After consulting, through the Registrar, the Agent of the Government and the delegates of the Commission, the President decided by an Order of 2 June 1975 that the oral hearings should open on 25 September.\\n\\n6. On 22 September 1975, the Court held a preparatory meeting to consider the oral stage of the procedure. On this occasion the Court compiled a list of questions which it sent to the parties appearing before it, requesting them to supply the required information in the course of their addresses. The Court also requested the Commission to produce a certain document.\\n\\n7. The oral hearings were held in public at the Human Rights Building in Strasbourg on 25 September 1975.\\n\\nThere appeared before the Court:\\n\\n- for the Government:\\n\\n\\tMr. H.

It originated in an application (no. 19392/92) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Commission under Article 25 by a political party, the United Communist Party of Turkey, and two Turkish nationals, Mr Nihat Sargın and Mr Nabi Yağcı, on 7 January 1992.\\n\\nThe Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (a) of the Convention and to Rule 32 of Rules of Court A. The object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 11 of the Convention.\\n\\n2.\\xa0\\xa0In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 § 3 (d), the applicants stated that they wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyers who would represent them (Rule\\xa030). The lawyers were given leave by the President to use the Turkish language in the written and oral stages of the proceedings (Rule 27 § 3).\\n\\n3.\\xa0\\xa0The Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Mr F. Gölcüklü, the elected judge of Turkish nationality (Article 43 of the Convention), and Mr\\xa0R.\\xa0Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 § 4 (b)). On 29 October 1996, in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr B. Walsh, Mr C. Russo, Mr\\xa0I.\\xa0Foighel, Mr A.N. Loizou, Mr J. Makarczyk, Mr P. Kūris and Mr\\xa0P.\\xa0van Dijk (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 § 5).\\n\\n4.\\xa0\\xa0As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 § 6), Mr Ryssdal, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Turkish Government (“the Government”), the applicants’ lawyers and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 § 1 and 38). Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the applicants’ memorial on 3 June 1997 and the Government’s memorial on 18 June.\\n\\n5.\\xa0\\xa0On 28 August 1997 the Chamber decided to relinquish jurisdiction forthwith in favour of a Grand Chamber (Rule 51). The Grand Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Mr Ryssdal, the President of the Court, and Mr R. Bernhardt, the Vice-President, together with the members and the four substitutes of the original Chamber, the latter being Mr A.B. Baka, Mr\\xa0M.A. Lopes Rocha, Mr R. Pekkanen and Mr\\xa0R.\\xa0Macdonald (Rule 51 §\\xa02\\xa0(a) and (b)). On the same day the President, in the presence of the Registrar, drew by lot the names of the seven additional members needed to complete the Grand Chamber, namely Mr\\xa0F.\\xa0Matscher, Mr N. Valticos, Mrs\\xa0E. Palm, Mr J.M. Morenilla, Sir\\xa0John\\xa0Freeland, Mr L. Wildhaber and Mr U. Lōhmus (Rule 51§\\xa02 (c)). Subsequently Mr\\xa0Ryssdal and Mr Walsh were unable to take part in the further consideration of the case (Rules 24 §\\xa01 and 51 § 3). Mr Ryssdal’s place as President of the Grand Chamber was taken by Mr\\xa0Bernhardt (Rules\\xa021 § 6 and 51 § 6).\\n\\n6.\\xa0\\xa0In accordance with the President’s decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 23 September 1997. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere appeared before the Court:\\n\\n\\t•\\tfor the Government\\u2028Mr\\tA.

Following a challenge by the applicant Government to the participation of Mr Dayıoğlu, the Grand Chamber, on 8 December 1999, noted that Mr Dayıoğlu had communicated to the President his intention to withdraw from the case (Rule 28 §§ 3 and\\xa04). The respondent Government subsequently appointed Mrs N. Ferdi to sit as an ad hoc judge in the case.\\n\\nAlso on 8 December 1999, the Grand Chamber considered objections raised by the respondent Government to the participation in the case of Mr\\xa0L. Loucaides, the judge elected in respect of Cyprus. Having examined the objections, the Grand Chamber decided on the same date to request Mr\\xa0Loucaides to withdraw from the case (Rule 28 § 4). The applicant Government subsequently appointed Mr L. Hamilton to sit as an ad hoc judge (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 1).\\n\\nOn 29 March 2000, following objections raised by the applicant Government to the participation of Mrs Ferdi in the case, the Grand Chamber decided that Mrs Ferdi was prevented from taking part in the consideration of the case (Rule 28 § 4). The respondent Government subsequently appointed Mr K. Fuad to sit as ad hoc judge in the case.\\n\\nFollowing the death of Mr Hamilton on 29 November 2000, the Agent of the applicant Government notified the Registrar on 13 December 2000 that his Government had appointed Mr S.

By letter dated 24 April 2000, and following the expiry of the time-limit, the Agent of the respondent Government requested leave to submit his Government's memorial before 24 July 2000. On 3 May 2000 the President, having consulted the Grand Chamber, agreed to extend the time-limit for the submission by the respondent Government of their memorial to 5 June 2000, it being pointed out that if the respondent Government failed to submit their memorial before the expiry of the new time-limit, they would be considered to have waived their right to submit a memorial.\\n\\nFollowing the failure of the respondent Government to comply with the new time-limit, the President, by letter dated 16 June 2000, informed the Agents of both Governments through the Registrar that the written pleadings were now closed. A copy of the applicant Government's memorial was sent to the Agent of the respondent Government for information purposes only. The President further informed the Agents in the same letter that, with a view to the hearing, a preparatory meeting with the Agents of both parties would be held on 7 September 2000.\\n\\n11.\\xa0\\xa0On 7 September 2000 the President met with the Agent and other representatives of the applicant Government in order to finalise arrangements for the hearing.

The respondent Government did not notify the Court of the names of their representatives in advance of the hearing and were not present at the hearing. In the absence of sufficient cause for the failure of the respondent Government to appear, the Grand Chamber decided to proceed with the hearing, being satisfied that such a course was consistent with the proper administration of justice (Rule\\xa064).\\n\\nThe President informed the Chairman of the Committee of Ministers of this decision in a letter dated 21 September 2000.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere appeared before the Court:\\n\\n(a)\\xa0\\xa0for the applicant Government\\u2028Mr\\tA.

By four votes to three, the Chamber held that there had been a violation of Article 11 of the Convention, that there was no need to examine separately the complaint under Article 7 of the Convention and that the respondent State was to pay each applicant 2,000 euros (EUR) in respect of non-pecuniary damage.\\n\\n6.\\xa0\\xa0On 26 February 2014 the Government asked for the case to be referred to the Grand Chamber by virtue of Article 43 of the Convention and Rule 73 of the Rules of Court.

He therefore requested that the case be heard in his absence and annexed an unsolicited document of nine pages in which, in substance, he replied to the arguments developed in the Government’s observations before the Grand Chamber. In a letter of 30 October 2014 the Court informed the Government that, given the applicants’ representative’s position, it might consider dispensing with a public hearing and giving the parties the opportunity to file a written reply to each other’s observations. In a fax of 3\\xa0November 2014 the Government stated that they did not have any objections to the case being examined without a public hearing and that they would at the same time appreciate the opportunity to file a written reply to the applicants’ observations.\\n\\n10.\\xa0\\xa0On 4 November 2014 the President decided to cancel the public hearing and first deliberations scheduled for 26 November 2014 and to invite the parties to submit, by 17 December 2014, further written observations in reply to each other’s initial observations. The applicants’ representative was informed that, should he not submit any new observations within the prescribed time-limit, the document annexed to his fax of 27 October 2014 would be treated as his reply to the arguments raised by the Government before the Grand Chamber.\\n\\n11.\\xa0\\xa0In November 2014 the applicants’ representative (Mr K.

They considered that the measure imposed on them had not been necessary in a democratic society and that it was incompatible with the principle of proportionality. Lastly, the first applicant party observed that the acts referred to in the judgment of the Spanish Supreme Court of 27 March 2003 against the applicant parties had taken place one year before the LOPP had come into force, and that Herri Batasuna had been dissolved even though the Supreme Court had not found it guilty of any such act occurring after the relevant Law had come into force.

The Schmidt and Dahlström case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (hereinafter referred to as \"the Commission\"). The case originated in an application against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Commission by two Swedish subjects, Mr. Folke Schmidt and Mr. Hans Dahlström, on 9 June 1972.\\n\\n2. The Commission’s request, to which was attached the report provided for under Article 31 (art. 31) of the Convention, was lodged with the registry of the Court on 9 October 1974, within the period of three months laid down by Articles 32 para. 1 and 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47). The request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration made by the Kingdom of Sweden recognising the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The purpose of the Commission’s request is to obtain a decision from the Court as to whether or not the facts of the case disclose a failure on the part of the Kingdom of Sweden to comply with the obligations binding on it under Articles 11 and 14 (art. 11, art. 14) of the Convention.\\n\\n3. The President of the Court deemed it conducive to the proper administration of justice to constitute a single Chamber to consider both the present case and that of the Swedish Engine Drivers’ Union (Rule 21 para. 6). On 15 October 1974, the President of the Court drew by lot, in the presence of the Registrar, the names of five of the seven judges required to sit as members of the Chamber, Mr. S. Petrén, the judge of Swedish nationality, and Mr. G. Balladore Pallieri, the President of the Court, being ex officio members under Article 43 (art. 43) of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 3 (b) of the Rules of Court respectively. The five judges so selected were Mr. H. Mosler, Mr. E. Rodenbourg, Mr. A. Favre, Mr. G. Wiarda and Mr. P. O’Donoghue (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 4) (art. 43). Mr. Favre died in November 1974 and Mr. Rodenbourg in October 1975; they were replaced by Mr. J. Cremona and Mrs. H. Pedersen, substitute judges.\\n\\nMr. G. Balladore Pallieri assumed the office of President of the Chamber in accordance with Rule 21 para. 5.\\n\\n4. The President of the Chamber ascertained, through the Registrar, the views of the Agent of the Swedish Government (hereinafter referred to as \"the Government\") and of the delegates of the Commission regarding the procedure to be followed. By an Order of 31 October 1974, the President of the Chamber decided that the Government should file a memorial within a time-limit expiring on 14 February 1975 and that the delegates should be entitled to file a memorial in reply within two months of receipt of the Government’s memorial.\\n\\nThe Government’s memorial was received at the registry on 17 February and that of the delegates on 26 March 1975.\\n\\n5. After consulting, through the Registrar, the Agent of the Government and the delegates of the Commission, the President decided by an Order of 2 June 1975 that the oral hearings should open on 25 September.\\n\\n6. On 22 September 1975, the Court held a preparatory meeting to consider the oral stage of the procedure. On this occasion the Court compiled a list of questions which it sent to the parties appearing before it, requesting them to supply the required information in the course of their addresses. The Court also requested the Commission to produce a certain document.\\n\\n7. The oral hearings were held in public at the Human Rights Building in Strasbourg on 25 September 1975.\\n\\nThere appeared before the Court:\\n\\n- for the Government:\\n\\n\\tMr. H.
